    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This American grilled cheese sandwich consists of rye bread, corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian
        or Thousand Island dressing. It's commonly associated with (and served at) most kosher-style delicatessens,
        although because it has meat and cheese together, it's not at all kosher. It’s also the top ordered sandwich at
        most of our nation's hotels and restaurant chains.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
        <li>8 deli slices of corned beef</li>
        <li>8 slices of Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
        <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
    </ul>
