    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This American grilled cheese sandwich consists of rye bread, corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian
        or Thousand Island dressing. It's commonly associated with (and served at) most kosher-style delicatessens,
        although because it has meat and cheese together, it's not at all kosher. It’s also the top ordered sandwich at
        most of our nation's hotels and restaurant chains.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
        <li>8 deli slices of corned beef</li>
        <li>8 slices of Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
        <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a large skillet or griddle on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Lightly butter one side of bread slices. Spread non-buttered sides with Thousand Island dressing. On 4 bread
            slices, layer 1 slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut and second slice of Swiss
            cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, buttered sides out.</li>
        <li>Grill sandwiches until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
