    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while
        this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.

        In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I
        have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much
        sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that
        way, not with this method.

        Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to
        great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on
        top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine,
        you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously,
        most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh
        mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan.</p>
